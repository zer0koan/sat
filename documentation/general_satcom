As a basic outline for a satellite uplink:
* Data enters a modem
* Sent to an up-converter
* Then to a high-power amplifier
* Finally sent through the antenna

Common amplifier types encountered in satellite literature are:
* TWTA : traveling wave tube amplifiers
* SSPA : solid state power amplifiers

Multiple transponders on-board will increase capacity using:
* CDMA : code division multiple access
* FDMA : frequency division multiple access
* TDMA : time division multiple access
This allows multiple streams of infomration to be sent simultaneously over a single communication channel, delineating them by use of code, variance of frequency, or timing respectively.

Downlinks then go from the satellite antenna to a low-noise amplifier (LNA), to the down-converter, to the modem, and then onward to a computer and/or end user.
